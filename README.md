# Awesome configuration files.
This is a sub module in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/Doron-Behar/dotfiles). It's a collection of other sub modules as well.

I have `tyrannical` but I still use `shifty`.

My key-bindings are consistent in their own way across all my dotfiles - `Vim`, `tmux` and `awesome`.
